    <h1>Croissant</h1>
    <p>
        A croissant is a French pastry made from puff pastry 
        in a crescent shape. It is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie 
        pastry inspired by the shape of the Austrian kipferl, 
        but using the French yeast-leavened laminated dough. 
        Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape.
